Assignment 1 is a AI tic-tac-toe program that uses one of the oldest and simplest AI algorithms: Minimax Algorithm. This algorithm assists the AI in finding the best possible move by creating a separate board and making a move for the Player and then recursively calls minimax. This ensures that the AI will pick the best move by assuming the player will make its best move.

This Assignment was the hardest one, but it was really cool to make, since we made an AI game. Although it was overwhelming and took me many hours, it is definitely my all-time favorite programs so far.
